# Divyanshi Mishra 👋
**GenAI & Autonomous Systems Engineer | LLM Architect | AI Automation Specialist**

I design and build **intelligent, autonomous systems that combine LLMs, retrieval pipelines, and large-scale automation**. From fine-tuning transformer models for healthcare AI to orchestrating end-to-end scraping and decision-making workflows, I focus on turning complex real-world problems into scalable, AI-driven solutions.
